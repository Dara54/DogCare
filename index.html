                <h1> Dogs in our shelter</h1><br> 
                <p>    Our shelter now houses 6 beautiful dogs. Bella, a sweet and gentle Labrador retriever, was found wandering the streets, 
                    lost and alone. Max, the playful Border Collie mix, was surrendered by its previous owners, who could no longer take 
                    care of it. Luna, a tiny black Maltipoo, that is known for its hypoallergenic coat, was rescued from the rubble after a fire.
                    Rocky is a Beagle that was found in a cardboard box near a dumpster.
                    Daisy, a furry Corgi who was sadly abandoned by its family when they moved to another town.
                    Oliver is a German shepherd who used to work with police and helped to find drugs.
                <br>
                       With care, and the support of the shelter volunteers, Bella, Max, Luna, Rocky, Daisy, and Oliver blossomed into happy, 
                    healthy dogs.
